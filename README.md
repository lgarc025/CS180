#LuisTrucking.com

Our group created a website and an iPhone app for the company Luis Trucking. The website is called luistrucking.com. There are 2 paths a user can take depending on what log in they use. There is a Driver and Owner login.
The owner log in has more capability and can add and remove users, Haulers, brokers, vendors and trucks. They are also allowed to accept and deny expenses and tickets. They can see all tickets and how much each driver has earned. The owner is also allowed error correction, if they accidentally delete a ticket or expense report, they can manually re-enter the report from the physical ticket the driver inputted 
For the Driver’s login they are able to add or remove pending expenses and tickets, tickets include what the driver’s truck is hauling, how much it is carrying and the rate at which the driver is paid. Expenses are bills for food, gas, ect.
The mobile app is only for Drivers, they are allowed to add tickets and expenses from their iPhone.
